      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am in 11th grade studying at American High School. I'm currently learning how to code and use various software platforms. Outside of school, I play cricket on a team. I have started playing since 6th grade. I enjoy spending time in nature. I go biking every week. I like playing badminton, soccer with friends. I am excited to create new technology that inspires the future generations to be involved in robust platforms..</p>
