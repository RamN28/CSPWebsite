        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section></section>
        <p>My name is Rushil Mantri and I'm currently a 11th grader at American High School. I'm an avid coder who takes part in many code and robotics competitions. In my free time I enjoy playing board games, reading books, and going to the park. I want to be apart of the coming surge of people in Computer Science and AI. I want to inspire the coming generations to use AI and other tools to not only improve day to day lives, but also solve many crucial problems at the local and global scale.</p>
